# Research Analysis
## Web scraping and analysis of research opportunities for STEM students

Web scraping of the website https://www.pathwaystoscience.org/ in order to pull information about research opportunities to STEM students. Then, data analysis is conducted in order to find patterns what the applications are looking for in students. 

### What does it do? 
* Gets every link on the main search page
* Filters it so only desirable links are scraped
* Scraped every page on filtered list, getting key information

### Debugging
* Selenium only works when the computer is turned on, if there is an error, most likely it is because the computer slept.

### Important
A handout with the information discovered in this analysis will be out soon, design by Clark Silva.  

### Colaboration
This is a volunteer work done for the Council of Undergraduate Research, assisted and mentored by Haseeb Kazi.
